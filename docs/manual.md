The E64-II (Enhanced 64-II) is a virtual computer system that runs on macOS and linux. It's inspired by the Commodore 64 and the Amiga 500. It actually blends both systems in a very specific way:
* From the Commodore 64:
	* The initial look & feel (character set and colors)
	* The directness, turn on and have a command prompt at your disposal
	* SID chips, actually two of them and capabilities to do stereo mixing
* From the Amiga 500:
	* The CPU, a Motorola 68000
	* A 12 bit color palette (4096 colors)
	* A large memory (actually 16mb)
